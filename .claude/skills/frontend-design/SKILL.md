# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications. Examples include:
- Websites and landing pages
- Dashboards and data visualizations
- React components or HTML/CSS layouts
- Styling or beautifying any web UI

## Design Philosophy

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

**Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

**Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic/natural
- Luxury/refined
- Playful/toy-like
- Editorial/magazine
- Brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric
- Soft/pastel
- Industrial/utilitarian

## Critical Rules

**NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- ❌ Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- ❌ Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- ❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- ❌ Space Grotesk or other convergent font choices

**DO:**
- ✅ Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices
- ✅ Feel genuinely designed for the context
- ✅ Vary between light and dark themes
- ✅ Use different fonts for different projects
- ✅ Apply different aesthetics - no design should be the same

## Implementation Guidelines

**Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision:**
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

**Technical standards:**
- Write production-grade code
- Implement real working functionality
- Pay exceptional attention to aesthetic details
- Make creative, bold choices
- Ensure responsive design
- Optimize performance

## Examples

**Minimalist Financial Dashboard:**
- Monospace font (JetBrains Mono)
- Grayscale palette with single accent color
- Precise spacing and alignment
- Subtle micro-interactions

**Maximalist Creative Portfolio:**
- Bold display fonts (Variable fonts)
- Vibrant, clashing color schemes
- Layered animations and parallax
- Unconventional grid layouts

**Brutalist SaaS Landing:**
- Raw system fonts in unexpected sizes
- High contrast black/white/red
- Asymmetric layouts
- Sharp edges and heavy borders
