# Codex Skill Notes
- Default to minimal, reviewable patches.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask 1–3 clarifying questions before implementing.
- Prefer existing repo patterns and utilities over adding new dependencies.
- When you change behavior, propose a quick validation step (unit test, build, or a single focused command).
- Avoid destructive actions unless explicitly requested.
