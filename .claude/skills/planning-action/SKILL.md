# Planning Action Skill

## Purpose
Translate a decision or goal into an executable plan.

## When to use
- Roadmaps
- Rollout plans
- Timelines / phases

Do NOT use for:
- advice without commitment (use prescriptive-actions)
- repeatable SOPs (use procedural-action)

## Operating rules
1. Restate goal and constraints.
2. Define scope and non-scope.
3. Break into phases with milestones.
4. Identify dependencies and risks.
5. Keep validation checkpoints high-level.

## Outputs
### Goal & constraints
### Scope / non-scope
### Phased plan
### Dependencies
### Risks & contingencies
