# {project} Domain Vocabulary

Domain model understanding and vocabulary patterns for this project.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| ENFORCE_TERMINOLOGY | true | Flag inconsistent term usage |
| RELATIONSHIP_DEPTH | 2 | Levels of entity relationships to trace |

## Instructions

1. Load domain entities from models
2. Understand entity relationships
3. Use consistent terminology
4. Validate against domain rules

## Red Flags - STOP and Reconsider

If you're about to:
- Use synonyms inconsistently (e.g., "user" vs "account" interchangeably)
- Create a model field that duplicates existing concepts
- Ignore relationship constraints

**STOP** -> Check glossary -> Verify relationships -> Then proceed
