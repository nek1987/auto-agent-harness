# {project} Research Patterns

Research workflow patterns tailored to this project's domain and research requirements.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| MAX_SOURCES | 10 | Maximum sources to consult per research task |
| SYNTHESIS_STYLE | comprehensive | Output style: concise, comprehensive, or academic |
| REQUIRE_CITATIONS | true | Always include source citations |

## Instructions

1. Identify the research question and scope
2. Select appropriate sources based on domain
3. Coordinate research subagents if available
4. Synthesize findings with proper attribution
5. Format output according to project conventions

## Red Flags - STOP and Reconsider

If you're about to:
- Make claims without source verification
- Skip the synthesis step
- Use sources outside the approved list

**STOP** -> Verify sources -> Synthesize properly -> Then report

## Workflow

### 1. Scope Definition

Define the research scope:
- Primary question
- Related sub-questions
- Domain boundaries
- Required source types

### 2. Source Selection

Approved source types for this project:
- [TODO: Add project-specific sources]
- Web search for recent information
- Documentation for technical details
- Academic sources for foundational concepts

### 3. Research Execution

For each source type:
1. Query appropriate source
2. Extract relevant information
3. Note confidence level
4. Record citation

### 4. Synthesis

Combine findings into coherent output:
- Summarize key findings
- Highlight consensus/disagreements
- Provide confidence assessment
- List all citations

## Project-Specific Patterns

### [TODO: Add patterns discovered in this project]

Example pattern:
```markdown
### Pattern: [Name]
- **When**: [Trigger condition]
- **Do**: [Actions]
- **Output**: [Expected format]
```

## Integration

This skill integrates with:
- Research subagents in `.claude/agents/`
- BAML types for structured outputs (if applicable)
- Documentation in `ai-docs/`

## Customization

Edit this file to add project-specific:
- Approved sources
- Domain vocabulary
- Output templates
- Quality criteria
