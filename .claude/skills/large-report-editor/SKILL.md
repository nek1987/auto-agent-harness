# Codex Skill Notes
- Mirrors `Agent_Instructions/Large_Report_Editor_Agent.md`.
- Always follow `99_Working_Files/AI_INSTRUCTIONS_LARGE_REPORT_EDITING.md` for chunked, context‑safe edits.
- No invented facts; cite all new statements with StableID + page anchors.
- Use backups in `99_Working_Files/Archive/` before major edits.
